### Overview

Face milling is a machining process where the cutting tool rotates perpendicular to the material’s surface, primarily used for creating a smooth, flat finish on workpieces. This project aims to provide an educational model for understanding the components and operations of a face milling machine.

### Features

- **3D Model**: A SolidWorks model of the face milling machine, detailing key components such as the spindle, motor, tool holder, and cutter.
- **Detailed Documentation**: A step-by-step explanation of the machine's working, applications, and parts.
- **Presentational Slide Deck**: A 10-12 slide presentation that summarizes the face milling machine's introduction, functionality, and applications.

```
### Getting Started
 **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dhruvpsr/Face_Milling_Machine.git

```

### Open the SolidWorks Model

- Open `FaceMillingAssembly.SLDASM` in SolidWorks to view the entire face milling machine assembly.
- Individual components are located in the `Components/` directory and can be opened separately for inspection.

### Usage

- **Educational Purposes**: The model and documentation serve as a learning resource for understanding the face milling process and the machine's mechanics.
- **Simulation and Analysis**: Use SolidWorks tools to simulate machine operations and analyze forces, torque, and other mechanical characteristics.

### Documentation

- The **OperationGuide.pdf** provides in-depth information on the face milling machine's working principles, component functions, and applications.
- The **PresentationSlides.pptx** includes a summarized view of the project, suitable for presentations.
